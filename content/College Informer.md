As part of a group in Software Development, I built a **Flask** app giving users a dashboard of information about logistics and residential life at a selected college. We utilized the College Scorecard and Bing Maps APIs to calculate driving time and transit directions from NYC. We pointed out 5 locations of interest, annual weather patterns, gas prices, and embedded maps with the Bing Maps, Open Meteo Weather, and GasBuddy APIs.

This was the first web dev project that I ever designed and built from scratch, and it still feels like a big deal to me (even though I could probably recreate it with far less effort now)
