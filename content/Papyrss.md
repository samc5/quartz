A modern RSS Reader built with a **Flask** backend, a **Flutter** frontend, and a **GraphQL** API. Papyrss uses a **MongoDB** cloud database and is hosted on an **Azure** virtual machine. Users can subscribe to RSS feeds and categorize them to their needs, as well as bookmark articles, and add feeds to the crowdsourced database. Iâ€™ve been building this app on and off since January and intend to continue expanding it for an eventual mobile release.
