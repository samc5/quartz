[Better BU Dining](https://budining.samcowan.net)

A tool I made with **Flask** and **Bootstrap** at the beginning of my freshman year to help myself and others with dietary restrictions navigate the BU dining halls. The actual BU Dining website offers supposed filters but these donâ€™t work as intended, particularly for gluten free food. Better BU Dining scrapes the dining hall website with **BeautifulSoup** and stores the menu every day in a **Firebase** database. Users can select dietary restrictions which the app looks for in the ingredients lists of the menu items.
